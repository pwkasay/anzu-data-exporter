A friend and old colleague, Leonard (\u201cLenny\u201d) Silverstein, brought to my attention today an interesting company, Haima Chek, Inc. (<a href=\"http://www.haimachek.com/home-en/\" target=\"_self\">http://www.haimachek.com/home-en/</a>). The medical device platform this company is developing may be of interest or as technology platform that may be complementary or synergistic with some of our portfolio companies.</p><p> </p><p>Lenny, who brought this to my attention, is a not an engineer or scientist (he\u2019s a corporate law guy), but has a deep interest in technology and compelling early stage opportunities. My connection to him is that he was outside corporate counsel to the first start-up I was involved with after leaving academia. Lenny has subsequently been directly involved in a handful of start-ups as an investor and/or an advisor.</p><p> </p><p>Back to the interesting company\u2026 Haima Chek is developing a liquid biopsy sampling device specifically designed to effectively sample rare target biomarkers. The initial R&amp;D efforts and incorporation have been in Germany, and they now have a US office (Santa Monica). The R&amp;D has thus far have been funded by grants from the German government, some angel investment, and in-kind investment with the John Wayne Cancer Institute for their POC studies. </p><p> </p><p>The device (a functionalized medical wire for use with a catheter or cannula; see <a href=\"http://www.haimachek.com/solutions/\" target=\"_self\">http://www.haimachek.com/solutions/</a>) offers a platform to capture rare cells, exosomes, pathogens, and cfDNA in vivo. The device comprises a modified, derivatized medical grade wire that is used with a catheter or cannula device. The wire is prepared to comprise antibodies or nucleic acid sequences in blood flowing past the capture area of the device as it transiently resides in a blood vessel. </p><p> </p><p></p><figure style=\"margin:0\"><img src=\"file:///C:/Users/PAIGEH~2/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image001.jpg\" width=\"450\" height=\"128\"/></figure><p></p><p> </p><p>Thus, the concept is that rare or extremely rare biomarker targets of clinical interest may only be present in sufficient quantity for analysis by concentrating a large volume blood sample. However, if one relied on a static, fixed volume sample (i.e., a traditional blood draw of small fixed volume), the volume limitations (10-20 ml for a typical blood sampling) may not allow for sufficient amounts of these targets, even if the full blood draw were concentrated into a sufficiently small volume.</p><p> </p><p>Unfortunately, a blood draw of larger volume presents either physiological limitations or technological limitations in terms of the applicability to this scenario. The solution Haima Chek has devised is a device that can be transiently inserted into a patient blood vessel for a fixed period of time to sample the flow of blood moving past the device. This effectively increases the volume of blood that can be sampled and quantity of biomarker that can be obtained for analysis. Moreover, the patient inconvenience and discomfort is minimal compared to potential competing technologies (e.g., a dialysis-based method). I was told that the first generation device can sample at least 1.7 liters of blood in about 30 minutes.</p><p> </p><p></p><figure style=\"margin:0\"><img src=\"file:///C:/Users/PAIGEH~2/AppData/Local/Temp/msohtmlclip1/01/clip_image002.jpg\" width=\"383\" height=\"288\"/></figure><p></p><p> </p><p>The company\u2019s lead programs are focused on oncology (<a href=\"http://www.haimachek.com/solution-oncology/\" target=\"_self\">http://www.haimachek.com/solution-oncology/</a>) and capture of circulating tumor cells (CTCs). The first generation device was tested clinically in Germany and I am told has good data. Although the first generation device had positive results, they are moving into further clinical POC studies using a second generation device. It is the second generation device that will be used in the studies carried out with the John Wayne Cancer Institute. </p><p> </p><p>The second major thrust is in cardiology and is focused on using the device to capture circulating endothelial cells (CECs) as a biomarker for vascular injury. This focus addresses a critical need for early detection of Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) and Stroke risk using markers that are directly associated with diseased arterial tissue or other markers to gauge patient risk levels. </p><p> </p><p>The current status of the company is that they are seeking investment to complete the planned studies with the John Wayne Cancer Institute (about $500k). I appreciate this well below the usual level of investment for our fund. That said, once the studies are completed, they plan to move to a series A, which would be in our wheelhouse. </p><p> </p><p>At the present time, if the technology is appealing, there may be an opportunity to facilitate through our network contacts with the right angel/pre-seed investor and lay the groundwork for participating later. Alternatively, this may one to just put on the radar screen to keep an eye on.

That being said, the pricing on Axsun\u2019s existing products could be competitive with SD-OCT at the right volumes (i.e. &gt;1000 units).  If we could work together to determine whether a 1310 SS-OCT engine has any benefits/advantages over an 850 SD-OCT source, then we could start having deeper conversations about additional development programs to help drive costs and prices even lower, providing you and IPG with the pricing roadmap you\u2019re after.  </p><p> </p><p>I also wanted to allay your concerns about Axsun being a potential competitor.  Axsun is an OEM component supplier and has no plans to become a systems integrator.  I really don\u2019t see Axsun developing a standalone system for any market vertical, let alone welding/additive.  If Axsun does do anything in additive/welding, it would be as a supplier to system integrators like yourself.  But you don\u2019t have to take my word for it.  You should feel free to follow up with Axsun\u2019s CEO, Jonathan Hartmann, so you can hear it straight from the horse\u2019s mouth.  On that note, are you planning on visiting the Boston area before Pho West?  If so, we should try to find a time to connect @ Axsun.  If not, maybe we can arrange a meeting at Pho West (assuming you go that event).    </p><p> </p><p>Ultimately, I think there\u2019s real potential for a very productive collaboration between the two companies, and I look forward to helping to move that conversation forward as efficiently/effectively as possible.</p><p> </p><p>Best,<br/> John</p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p><strong>From:</strong> Paul Webster [<a href=\"mailto:pwebster@laserdepth.com\" target=\"_self\">mailto:pwebster@laserdepth.com</a>] <br/> <strong>Sent:</strong> Tuesday, December 19, 2017 11:20 PM<br/> <strong>To:</strong> John Ho &lt;<a href=\"mailto:jch@anzupartners.com\" target=\"_self\">jch@anzupartners.com</a>&gt;<br/> <strong>Cc:</strong> Roger Bowes &lt;<a href=\"mailto:rbowes@laserdepth.com\" target=\"_self\">rbowes@laserdepth.com</a>&gt;<br/> <strong>Subject:</strong> RE: Congrats!</p><p> </p><p>Let&#x27;s start with what you can do on the swept source itself if the driving and digitization electronics to us.</p><p> </p><p>On Dec 19, 2017 10:53 PM, &quot;John Ho&quot; &lt;<a href=\"mailto:jch@anzupartners.com\" target=\"_self\">jch@anzupartners.com</a>&gt; wrote:</p><p>Hi Paul,</p><p> </p><p>Thanks for getting back to me.

I don&#x27;t think that I&#x27;ll be able to pull it together before the holidays, but some further discussion is likely warranted.

Would you have interest in an introduction or is this going to be too early for you?</p><p> </p><ul><li>BERKM works on solving      plastic pollution and CO2 emission problems. It does this via its additive      technology that enables 8-20% less plastic per packaging unit. This means      a reduction in plastic consumption and CO2 emissions. Moreover, technology      enables increased product shelf-life, substantial cost savings from raw      materials &amp;equipment, and new product lines.
