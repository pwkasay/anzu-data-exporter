The expected entries are as follows, please note that some of the entries have specific options for you to choose from:
Deal Name (dealname),
Lead Owner (from hubspot_owner_id_details find First Name and Last Name and concat them together),
Support Owner (from team_member_1_details find First Name and Last Name and concat them together),
Broad Category (broad_category_updated),
Subcategory (subcategory),
Fund (fund),
Created Date (createdate)

Use these to help yourself understand the type and style of data being processed, but again, please create new subcategories that best fit the information you are parsing. You do not have to use the provided subcategories.
Additionally, you do not have to include any explanation text on why you chose the three subcategories. Simply returning a json object with the field specified is enough. And when you return the json you don't have to include the Broad Category in your recommendation, in other words. You don't have to append the Broad Category to the Sub category with hyphens like Life Sciences & Healthcare - Immunology, you can just provide the suggested sub category.
 Thank you.
